    <h1>White sauce pasta</h1>

    <p>I came up with this white spaghetti sauce recipe one night to serve with dried pasta and spicy battered shrimp. My husband lived in Italy for three years, so he's really picky about his Italian cuisine. He loved this sauce and thought I spent all day on dinner. It is really hard to mess up this kind of white sauce. In my opinion, it's similar to Alfredo sauce but without cheese.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/4 cup butter</li>
        <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>

        <li>2 cups milk</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley</li>
        <li>1 pound spaghetti</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
